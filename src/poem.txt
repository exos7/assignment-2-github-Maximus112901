Suspicious Banana (by me and https://www.aipoemgenerator.org/generate/dd6bb8ab-aaa2-454f-a02e-8a53ee6564fe-1699538174930-1699538185077)

In the fruit stand, oh so sleek and slim
A banana peel, its curves so dim
Yellow skin, a treacherous disguise
Hides a waxy core, a twisted prize

A banana has vitamin B6, Potassium
Vitamin C, Fiber, Manganese, and Magnesium
Also called Musa from the Musaceae family
I will consume them happily 

Its shape so straight, yet curved with care
A sinister smile, beyond compare
In this fruit so pure and bright
Lurks a sneaky villain, in plain sight

No one suspects, no one can tell
The secrets hidden within its shell
But if you listen closely to its call
It whispers tales of mischief and squall

So beware, my friend, don't let it fool
This seemingly innocent fruit, so cool
For beneath its surface, a plot unfolds
And danger lurks, as stories unfold
